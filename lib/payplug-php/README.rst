This is the documentation of PayPlug's PHP library. It is designed to
help developers to use PayPlug as payment solution in a simple, yet robust way.

You can create a PayPlug account at https://www.payplug.com/.

For version **PHP 5.2** or older you must refer to PayPlug PHP V1.

To get started, add the following to your PHP script (if you are not running a framework):

.. sourcecode :: php

    <?php
    require_once("PATH_TO_PAYPLUG/payplug_php/lib/init.php");

Usage
-----

Here's how simple it is to create a payment request:

.. sourcecode :: php

    <?php
    require_once("PATH_TO_PAYPLUG/payplug_php/lib/init.php"); // If not using a framework

    // Loads your account's parameters that you've previously downloaded and saved
    Payplug\Payplug::init(array(
      'secretKey' => 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
      'apiVersion' => 'THE_API_VERSION_YOU_WANT',
    ));

    // Create a payment request of â‚¬9.99. The payment confirmation (IPN) will be sent to "http://www.example.com/callbackURL"
    $payment = Payplug\Payment::create(array(
            'amount'            => 999,
            'currency'          => 'EUR',
            'customer'          => array(
                'email'             => 'john.doe@example.com',
                'first_name'        => 'John',
                'last_name'         => 'Doe'
            ),
            'hosted_payment'    => array(
                'return_url'        => 'https://www.example.com/thank_you_for_your_payment.html',
                'cancel_url'        => 'https://www.example.com/so_bad_it_didnt_make_it.html'
            ),
            'notification_url'      => 'http://www.example.com/callbackURL'
    ));

    // You will be able to find how the payment object is built in the documentation.
    // For instance, if you want to get an URL to the payment page, you get do:
    $paymentUrl = $payment->hosted_payment->payment_url;

    // Then, you can redirect the user to the payment page
    header("Location: $paymentUrl");
    exit();
